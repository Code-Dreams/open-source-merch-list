# open-source-merch-list
This repo is meant to make it easier to find merchendise for open source projects and organizations that promote open source software

This is a continuously updated list, and perhaps in the future create a dedicated website for this. 

NOTE 1: I have not bought from any of these places yet, so I can not say anything about the quality of any of these websites

NOTE 2: Please contact me if you see anything wrong with the links :)

NOTE 3: These links are not in any order yet
