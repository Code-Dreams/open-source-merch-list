# open-source-merch-list
This repo is meant to make it easier to find merchandise for open source projects and organizations that promote open source software

This list is continuously updated 

NOTE 1: I've tried to make sure these are the correct and official merch shops, but please double check if you are unsure, and send me a message so I can correct it

NOTE 2: I have not bought from any of these places yet, so I can not say anything about the quality of any of these websites
